      upstream)
    + Enable-NX.patch (we don't want NX just yet until the whole boot
      stack is NX-capable)

      is 4)

    - Define an EFI_ARCH variable, and use that for paths to shim. This
      makes it possible to build a shim for other architectures than amd64.
    - Set EFIDIR=$distro for dh_auto_install; that will let files be installed
