    + Make-sbat_var.S-parse-right-with-buggy-gcc-binutils.patch (now
      upstream)
    + Enable-NX.patch (we don't want NX just yet until the whole boot
      stack is NX-capable)
    + block-grub-sbat3-debian.patch (not needed now upstream grub SBAT
      is 4)
  * Cherry-pick 2 new patches from upstream for grub revocations:

    - Define an EFI_ARCH variable, and use that for paths to shim. This
      makes it possible to build a shim for other architectures than amd64.
    - Set EFIDIR=$distro for dh_auto_install; that will let files be installed
